Redux:
Redux is basically used to create a global store (a global state) for the react app so that any event 
int the react app in any component leads to state change,we can change the state globally.
And all the component dependent of the state can render accordingly.
Redux is basically a state management tool.




Webpack:
I have not used Webpack just know that it is use to bundle all the module and dependecies into one file
So if any cdn is used or any other module it can be bundled into one file so that it dont lead to unwanted 
break down of app.
